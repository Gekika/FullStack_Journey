*********************************************************************************  THE CASCADE   **************************************************************************************
Say we have different Css rules pinting to one element here is where the cascading decides 
which rulles get applied matters heirachy 
The order of importance is what matters 
The one latest on the cascade is what appears
 In a CSS file this is teh order of application:
            - External css
            - Internal Css
            - inline Css


The rules that apply are in relation to this 4 rules:

1. Position:
The position matters the lower the rule the higher the priority
Sample: 
        li{
            color: red;
            color: blue;
           }
           here blue will be applied

2. Specificity:
How specific is the slector
ID Selector is the most specific and the code below the color would be orange
Sample: 
        li{color: blue;}
        .first-class{ color:red;}
        li[draggable] {color: purple;}
        #first-id {color:orange;}

3. Type:
External <link rel="stylesheet" href="./stylesheet.css">
Internal <style> h1{color: blue}</style>
inline <h1 style = "color:red"></h1>
inline is the one with most priority
